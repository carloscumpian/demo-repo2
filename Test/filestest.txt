Kakoune dependencies are:

    A C++17 compliant compiler (GCC >= 7 or clang >= 6) along with its associated C++ standard library (libstdc++ or libc++)

    ncurses with wide-characters support (>= 5.3, generally referred to as libncursesw)

To build, just type make in the src directory. To generate man pages, type make man in the src directory.

Kakoune can be built on Linux, MacOS, and Cygwin. Due to Kakoune relying heavily on being in a Unix-like environment, no native Windows version is planned.
